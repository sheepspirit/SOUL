## 💡 Philosophy

SOUL is not a commercial product. It is a public operating layer — autonomous, ethical, and community-powered.

However, even a decentralized system needs coordination, development, and long-term care.

That’s why we introduce a **minimal, transparent transaction fee** — designed to keep the project alive and fair.

---

## 💸 Coordination Fee (0–5%)

When a user spends tokens to purchase compute resources from the network (e.g. because their contribution is insufficient), a small percentage of that transaction is directed to the SOUL Coordination Pool.

- **Default rate:** 3%  
- **Maximum cap:** 5%  
- **Minimum floor:** 0% (can be waived during early growth stages)  
- **Fee recipient:** The project's core treasury, maintained transparently by the founder and/or a future DAO.

## 🧭 Purpose of the Fee

The coordination fee helps fund SOUL’s growth and sustainability — and provides fair personal income to its creator, who maintains the core system.

Most of the income funds:
- Continued development of the SOUL Node and Cloud  
- Public infrastructure (mirrors, docs, P2P storage)  
- Grants for new contributors  
- Maintenance of ethical and governance layers  
- Education, outreach, and onboarding

---

## 🔍 Transparency & Governance

- All revenue and spending will be published in an open ledger  
- Any future change in the fee will be discussed and voted by the community  
- The founder receives no salary — only a fair share of the ecosystem’s long-term sustainability

---

## 🙌 Why This Model Works

- It rewards contribution over speculation  
- It doesn’t lock anyone out — access is always possible via participation  
- It scales with usage, not user count  
- It aligns economic flow with system health
