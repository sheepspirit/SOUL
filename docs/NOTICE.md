## 🧠 Intellectual Origin

SOUL is not just software.  
It is an open digital infrastructure for ethical, decentralized computing — built to resist corporate monopolies, enable collective intelligence, and empower people over machines.

The core concepts, structure, and narrative of SOUL (including the terms “Proof-of-Contribution,” “Soul Traders,” “Genesis Layer,” and the operating logic outlined in `architecture.md`, `mvp.md`, and `proof-of-contribution.md`) are original creations of the author.
