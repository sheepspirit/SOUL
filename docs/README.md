# SOUL: Self-Operating & Upgradeable Linux

> **Project Lead & Vision Architect**: Sergey Kokurin ([@sheepspirit](https://github.com/sheepspirit))

SOUL is an open-source, decentralized operating layer designed to harness idle computing resources from everyday users. It aims to create a resilient, autonomous, and upgradeable global intelligence network ‚Äî an ethical and efficient alternative to corporate cloud ecosystems.

## üß≠ Mission

To democratize access to computing power and foster collective intelligence through a self-operating, self-upgrading infrastructure that prioritizes ethical considerations and user sovereignty.

## üåü Key Features

- **Self-Upgrading Core**: Autonomous improvements based on community feedback and real usage.
- **Distributed Compute Network**: Leveraging idle machines for tasks like rendering, ML training, and simulations.
- **Proof-of-Contribution Protocol**: Verifiable contributions rewarded through a tokenized incentive system.
- **Modular & Extensible Architecture**: Built on Linux, designed for flexibility and scalability.

## üß† Core Values

- **Ethical Computation**: Technology must serve people, not control them.
- **Transparency**: All processes and code are open for review and discussion.
- **Decentralization with Responsibility**: Power without accountability is just chaos.
- **Collective Intelligence**: We are smarter together ‚Äî SOUL exists to unlock that.
