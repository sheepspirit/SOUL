# SOUL: Self-Operating & Upgradeable Linux

> **Project Lead & Vision Architect**: Sergei Kokurin ([@sheepspirit](https://github.com/sheepspirit))

SOUL is an open-source, decentralized operating layer that transforms idle computing resources into a global, self-improving intelligence network — an ethical and sovereign alternative to corporate cloud ecosystems.

## 🧭 Mission

To democratize access to computing power and foster collective intelligence through an infrastructure that is autonomous, ethical, and user-driven.

## 🧠 Core Values

- **Ethical Computation** – technology must serve, not control
- **Transparency** – open processes and auditable code
- **Decentralization with Responsibility** – freedom anchored in accountability
- **Collective Intelligence** – we are smarter together

## 🌐 Key Features

- **Self-Upgrading Core** – evolves based on usage and feedback
- **Distributed Compute Network** – idle machines powering real work (rendering, ML, simulations)
- **Proof-of-Contribution Protocol** – verifiable work rewarded via tokens
- **Modular Architecture** – Linux-based, extensible and scalable

## 🧬 Project Origins

SOUL was envisioned by Sergei Kokurin in 2025 as a response to the growing centralization of AI and infrastructure. It is built on the belief that digital intelligence must remain open, decentralized, and aligned with human values.
