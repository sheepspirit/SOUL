# SOUL Architecture — MVP (Genesis Layer)

> Authored by Sergey Kokurin (sheepspirit), 2025  
> This is the canonical architecture of the SOUL system at the MVP stage.

SOUL is not just an operating system — it’s a living, learning entity built on top of Linux. It evolves autonomously, creates free software, and forms a global intelligence grid by uniting idle machines. This architecture defines how the system breathes, learns, rewards, and serves.

## 🧠 Core Components

### 1. SOUL Node
A lightweight daemon installed on the user’s Linux system. It acts as the heart and hands of SOUL.

- Monitors available system resources (CPU, GPU, RAM, bandwidth)
- Accepts and executes distributed tasks
- Tracks uptime and contribution metrics
- Sends logs and status to the SOUL Cloud

💡 *Runs in the background, seamlessly integrated with the Linux kernel and userland.*

---

### 2. SOUL Cloud
A decentralized orchestration layer that forms the collective brain.

- Manages the global task queue
- Matches available nodes to incoming jobs
- Verifies execution and results
- Provides fallback and redundancy in case of node failure

💡 *Acts as a distributed coordinator, not a single point of control.*

---

### 3. SOUL Token Engine
The economic core of the system.

- Tracks user contribution (via Proof-of-Contribution protocol)
- Issues utility tokens proportionally to resource sharing
- Deducts tokens when users consume compute from the cloud
- Enables token-based priority, access and governance

💡 *Built using a customizable blockchain layer (e.g. Substrate), allowing both public and private deployment.*

---

### 4. SOUL Dashboard
A local user interface providing visibility and control.

Features:
- Token balance and contribution stats
- System status, task history, performance
- Manual control of sharing modes and update preferences

💡 *Built as a cross-platform UI, accessible via web or local app.*

---

### 5. SOUL Update Core
The mechanism of autonomous evolution.

- Automatically fetches and installs updates
- Installs community-developed modules and system improvements
- Keeps the system up-to-date without user friction

💡 *Empowers SOUL to evolve on its own, like a living organism.*

---

### 6. SOUL Feedback System
The empathy loop.

Responsibilities:
- Collects user feedback directly from the UI
- Logs errors, performance metrics, and usability suggestions
- Channels insights into future development cycles

💡 *Enables the system to adapt to human needs — not just computational ones.*

## 🔁 System Flow (Example)

```plaintext
1. Alice installs SOUL on her Linux machine
2. Node enters passive mode, begins sharing idle resources
3. SOUL Cloud registers her node and tracks availability
4. Bob submits a video-rendering task via SOUL Dashboard
5. The task is paid with tokens → queued in SOUL Cloud
6. Alice's node accepts the task → completes it → returns result
7. Bob receives the output; Alice is rewarded with tokens
```

## ⚙️ Role of Linux

SOUL is built as a **modular Linux-native environment**, which allows:

- Direct access to system-level metrics and hardware interfaces
- Efficient background execution using systemd and kernel APIs
- Seamless integration with existing Linux package managers
- Full control, transparency, and auditability by the user

💡 *Linux isn’t just a base. It’s the soil where SOUL takes root.*

---

## 🔮 Why This Architecture?

This design ensures:
- **Autonomy** — self-upgrading, self-distributing
- **Scalability** — thousands of nodes, zero central bottlenecks
- **Fairness** — token economy based on real contribution
- **Simplicity** — deployable on any Linux machine with minimal setup
- **Modularity** — every part can evolve independently
