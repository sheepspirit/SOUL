# SOUL — Attack Vectors & Defense Strategies

> Authored by Sergei Kokurin (sheepspirit), 2025  
> This document outlines potential abuse scenarios within the SOUL network and how the system is designed to detect, mitigate, or prevent them.  
> The goal is not blind trust — but cryptographic verification, transparent auditability, and incentive-aligned defense.

## 🔐 Security Principles

SOUL is built on these core principles:

- ✅ Real work must be verifiable
- ✅ Rewards are based on contribution, not presence
- ✅ All actions are traceable, but privacy-preserving
- ✅ Trust is earned, not assumed

---

## 🧨 Known Attack Vectors & Mitigations

---

### 1. Fake Task Execution  
**Description:** A node pretends to perform a task but doesn't actually compute anything.  
**Intent:** Earn tokens without spending resources.

**Defense:**
- ✅ Output Hash mismatch alerts the requester  
- ✅ Proof Package must match expected result  
- ✅ Peer validation re-checks task integrity  
- ✅ Optional: Redundant execution on multiple nodes

---

### 2. Resource Faking  
**Description:** The node claims it used massive CPU/RAM/GPU resources for a small task.  
**Intent:** Inflate token rewards fraudulently.

**Defense:**
- ✅ System-level metrics (from `/proc`, `perf`, `cgroups`)  
- ✅ SOUL Agent signs logs at collection time  
- ✅ Cross-verification by random peers  
- 🧠 (Planned): AI-based anomaly detection of usage patterns

---

### 3. Sybil Attack (Fake Nodes Farm)  
**Description:** One user runs hundreds of fake nodes to simulate task completion between them.  
**Intent:** Farm tokens from inside their own fake ecosystem.

**Defense:**
- ✅ Node reputation system penalizes isolated/fake behavior  
- ✅ Random task assignment prevents self-selection  
- ✅ Task origin verification prevents internal task looping  
- 🪪 Optional: Identity/Proof-of-Access layer in DAO voting scenarios

---

### 4. Result Reuse (Replay Attack)  
**Description:** The node submits an old result for a new task, hoping to get paid again.  
**Intent:** Earn multiple rewards for one-time work.

**Defense:**
- ✅ Every task is hashed and time-bound  
- ✅ Output Hash must match **new** workload  
- ✅ Proof Package is invalid if resubmitted

---

### 5. Passive Farming (Proof-of-Idling)  
**Description:** The node remains always online, trying to earn tokens just by being available.  
**Intent:** "Earn without doing" via uptime exploitation.

**Defense:**
- ✅ No task = no reward  
- ✅ UptimeMultiplier ≤ 1.0 (only reduces reward, never increases it)  
- ✅ Nodes with high uptime but no contributions receive lower reputation over time

---

### 6. Tampered Logs  
**Description:** User edits system logs before submission to simulate fake usage.  
**Intent:** Inflate PoC metrics.

**Defense:**
- ✅ Logs are signed at the source (SOUL Agent)  
- ✅ Invalid or unsigned logs are rejected  
- ✅ Optional: Logs hashed to blockchain for full integrity

---

### 7. Task Injection / Self-serving Requests  
**Description:** A malicious user submits tasks they can predict or manipulate, then solves them via their own nodes.  
**Intent:** Game the system through circular contribution.

**Defense:**
- ✅ Requesters are linked to task IDs  
- ✅ Internal task attribution and audit trail  
- ✅ Randomized execution assignment  
- ✅ Redundancy flags suspicious job pairings

## 👁 Future Enhancements

- 🧠 Machine learning classifiers to detect synthetic workloads  
- 🔗 zk-SNARK-based proof of execution  
- 🧪 Public challenge rounds for validation  
- 🛡 Decentralized Moderation Council for dispute resolution  
- 🧬 Staking model to punish malicious actors at economic level

## 🔚 Final Note

Security in SOUL is not reactive — it’s **proactive, cryptographic, and cooperative**.  
We don’t rely on secrecy. We rely on transparency, verification, and shared responsibility.
