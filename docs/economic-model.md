# 💸 Economic Model

> Authored by Sergei Kokurin (sheepspirit), 2025 
> This document outlines the economic mechanics and currency flow within the SOUL system.

SOUL introduces a **sustainable, utility-based token economy** designed to reward real contribution, support open access to computing power, and ensure long-term independence from corporate funding or control.

---

## 🧩 Core Principles

- **Contribution = Value:** Tokens are earned through measurable resource sharing (CPU, GPU, RAM, bandwidth)
- **No Paywall:** All users can participate and benefit without upfront payment
- **Open Incentives:** Economic rewards are transparent, auditable, and fairly distributed
- **Minimal Extraction:** A small coordination fee (max 5%) funds the project's development and maintenance

## 🔄 Token Lifecycle

| Action                | Token Flow                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resource Sharing      | User earns SOUL tokens (ST)                                |
| Compute Consumption   | User spends ST to access network power                     |
| Not Enough Tokens     | User purchases ST using ETH, BTC, or USDT                  |
| Ecosystem Support     | Coordination fee is auto-converted to USDT and sent to treasury |

## 💱 Token Details

- **Token Name:** SOUL Token (ST)  
- **Type:** Utility token (non-speculative)  
- **Supply:** Elastic — minted based on verified contribution  
- **Networks:** EVM-compatible Layer 2s (e.g. Base, Arbitrum, Polygon)  
- **Fiat Onboarding:** Optional via external P2P or swap platforms

---

## 📉 No Artificial Scarcity

SOUL deliberately avoids mechanisms that create speculative pressure:

- No fixed supply
- No burning or token decay
- No staking rewards or yield farming
- No pre-sale, VC allocation, or airdrops

All tokens are **earned or exchanged for access** — never hoarded or gamed.

---

## 💸 Coordination Fee

- Applied when a user spends ST to request compute power  
- **Default: 3%**, adjustable by community vote (max: 5%)  
- **Converted to USDT** for sustainable treasury management  
- Funds are used for:
  - Infrastructure and code maintenance
  - Contributor microgrants
  - Ecosystem growth
  - Fair income for the core maintainer

---

## 📊 Market Balance

The price of ST naturally reflects the balance of supply and demand:

- If compute resources are abundant → ST becomes cheaper  
- If demand outpaces supply → ST becomes more valuable  
- The network adapts to this organically — no central control needed

This keeps speculation unattractive and utility front and center.

## 🧬 Future Expansions

- **DAO governance:** Fee votes, treasury allocation, roadmap priorities  
- **Reputation-weighted contribution models**  
- **Modular extensions:** external compute markets, organizational nodes
