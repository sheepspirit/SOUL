## 💡 Philosophy

SOUL is not a commercial product. It is a public operating layer — autonomous, ethical, and community-powered.

However, even a decentralized system needs coordination, development, and long-term care.

That’s why we introduce a **minimal, transparent transaction fee** — designed to keep the project alive, fair, and user-first.

---

## 💸 Coordination Fee (0–5%)

When a user spends tokens to purchase compute resources from the network (e.g. because their contribution is insufficient), a small percentage of that transaction is directed to the SOUL Coordination Pool.

- **Default rate:** 3%  
- **Maximum cap:** 5%  
- **Minimum floor:** 0% (can be waived during early growth stages)  
- **Fee recipient:** The project's core treasury, maintained transparently by the founder and/or a future DAO  
- **Fee currency:** The fee may be automatically converted to **USDT** or another stablecoin for sustainability and clarity

## 🧭 Purpose of the Fee

The coordination fee helps fund SOUL’s growth and sustainability — and provides fair personal income to its creator, who maintains the core system.

The coordination fee ensures:

- Continued development of SOUL’s core components (Node, OS layer, cloud logic)
- Maintenance of public infrastructure (mirrors, docs, updates, peer validation)
- Microgrants for contributors and early node operators
- Education, onboarding, and ethical community growth
- A sustainable income for the system’s founder and long-term steward

This is not about profit extraction — it's about keeping the mission alive.

---

## 🔍 Transparency & Governance

- All revenue and spending will be published in an open ledger  
- Any future change in the fee must be proposed and voted by the community  
- The founder receives no fixed salary — only a share of the ecosystem’s real economic flow

---

## 🙌 Why This Model Works

- It rewards contribution over speculation  
- It ensures open access through participation  
- It scales naturally with network usage  
- It funds the public good while staying transparent  
- It reflects SOUL’s core principle: **earn your place, or support others who do**

> “This is not a toll. It's a seed — to help SOUL grow stronger, freer, and forever open.”
