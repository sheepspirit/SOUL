## 🪙 What Is the SOUL Token?

The **SOUL Token (ST)** is the native unit of value within the SOUL ecosystem.  
It is earned through **Proof-of-Contribution**, and spent to access collective computational power.

SOUL is not a speculative asset. It is a **utility token** that reflects real work, and is only useful inside the network.

---

## 🔄 Token Flow

1. **Earn:** Share idle CPU/GPU/RAM → receive ST  
2. **Spend:** Request computing tasks → pay in ST  
3. **Trade:** Buy ST using ETH, BTC, or USDT if you need more than you earn  
4. **Fee:** A small coordination fee is collected on each transaction

---

## 💱 Purchasing ST with Crypto

Users can acquire ST if needed, using other cryptocurrencies:

- Supported assets: **ETH**, **BTC**, **USDT**, **MATIC** (expandable)
- Preferred network: **Ethereum Layer-2 (e.g. Base, Arbitrum, Polygon)** for low fees
- Methods:
  - Native DEX swap (Uniswap integration planned)
  - Fiat gateway via P2P (optional later)

> Example: "Buy 25 ST for 0.0014 ETH"

🧠 **Note:** Computation can only be paid in ST. No direct ETH/BTC payments inside the network.

---

## 💸 Coordination Fee (in USDT)

To ensure sustainability, a **small fee (e.g. 3%)** is applied when ST is spent to purchase compute power.  
This fee is automatically converted to **USDT** (or another stable asset) and redirected to the project treasury.

The funds are used to:

- Maintain and improve SOUL infrastructure
- Support contributors
- Cover operational costs (nodes, servers, community tools)
- Provide a fair income to the core maintainer

The fee amount and logic may be adjusted by future governance.

## 🧩 Why Not Use ETH or BTC Directly?

- 🧠 It breaks internal incentive logic (why contribute if others just pay?)
- 🌐 It exposes the network to volatility and external manipulation
- 🔐 It weakens the project’s ability to evolve economic dynamics
- ⚖️ ST gives the network its own economic identity and balance

---

## 🏛️ Token Management

- All internal transactions are in ST
- Conversion is optional, external, and user-initiated
- Governance may evolve to support inflation rules, staking, voting, and reputation mechanics

---

## 🧠 Final Notes

- No pre-mint  
- No VC allocations  
- No artificial scarcity  
- No token decay or forced devaluation  
- Tokens are earned or purchased — always tied to utility
