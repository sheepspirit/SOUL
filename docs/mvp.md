## Overview

This document outlines the minimum viable functionality required to launch the SOUL system — a self-operating and upgradeable Linux-based OS that rewards users for contributing idle computational power and evolves autonomously.

---

## MVP Components

### 1. SOUL Sharing — *Idle Power Contribution Mode*
**What it does:**  
Allows the system to utilize a computer’s idle computational resources.

**Why it matters:**  
Validates the core hypothesis — whether users are willing to share power for the greater good.

---

### 2. SOUL Tokens — *Contribution Accounting & Rewards*
**What it does:**  
Allocates tokens proportionally to shared resources (CPU, GPU, RAM, uptime).

**Why it matters:**  
Kickstarts the trust economy, incentivizes participation, and quantifies user contribution.

---

### 3. SOUL Cloud Tasks — *Decentralized Task Queue*
**What it does:**  
Distributes user-generated tasks across available machines in the SOUL network.

**Why it matters:**  
Tests the viability of distributed computing and ensures robust task orchestration.

---

### 4. SOUL Requests — *Cloud Compute Access*
**What it does:**  
Enables users to execute heavy computation tasks by paying tokens.

**Why it matters:**  
Proves the utility of tokens and validates demand for collective compute resources.

---

### 5. SOUL Update Core — *Autonomous Upgrade Engine*
**What it does:**  
Automatically installs updates, patches, and new features without user intervention.

**Why it matters:**  
Embeds the principle of self-evolution and ensures continuous system improvement.

---

### 6. SOUL Dashboard — *Graphical Management Interface*
**What it does:**  
Shows system status, token balance, task history, CPU usage, and mode control.

**Why it matters:**  
Lowers the entry barrier, improves UX, and provides operational transparency.

---

### 7. SOUL Feedback — *Log & Feedback System*
**What it does:**  
Enables users to report bugs or suggest improvements directly from the UI.

**Why it matters:**  
Allows SOUL to evolve through real-world feedback and community engagement.
