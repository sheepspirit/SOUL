## 🪙 What Is the SOUL Token?

The **SOUL Token (ST)** is the native unit of value inside the SOUL ecosystem.  
It is earned through **Proof-of-Contribution**, and spent to access collective computational power.

SOUL is not a speculative asset. It is a **utility token** that reflects real work.

---

## 🔄 Token Flow

1. **Earn:** Share idle CPU/GPU/RAM → receive ST  
2. **Spend:** Request computing tasks → pay in ST  
3. **Trade:** Buy ST using ETH, BTC, or USDT if you need more than you earn  
4. **Burn (optional):** A % of spent tokens can be burned to control inflation

---

## 💱 Purchasing ST with Crypto

Users can acquire ST if needed, using other cryptocurrencies:

- Supported assets: **ETH**, **BTC**, **USDT**, **MATIC** (expandable)
- Preferred network: **Ethereum Layer-2 (e.g. Base, Arbitrum, Polygon)** for low fees
- Method:  
  - Native DEX swap (Uniswap integration planned)  
  - Fiat gateway via P2P (optional later)

> Example: "Buy 25 ST for 0.0014 ETH"

No computation can be paid directly in ETH — only in ST.

## 🧩 Why Not Use ETH or BTC Directly?

- 🧠 It breaks internal incentive logic (why contribute when others just pay?)
- 🌐 It exposes network to volatility and outside manipulation
- 🔐 It weakens your ability to evolve the economic model
- ⚖️ SOUL must have its own internal "gravity"

---

## 🏛️ Token Management

- All internal transactions occur in ST
- Conversion is external, optional, and user-driven
- Long-term: DAO may govern supply, inflation, staking, voting, etc.

---

## 🔥 Optional Mechanisms

- **Partial Burn**: e.g. 1–2% of each transaction is burned  
- **Community Fund**: 1–3% redirected to ecosystem growth  
- **Staking Pool**: future support for staking idle ST for passive yield or influence

---

## 🧠 Final Notes

- No pre-mint  
- No VC allocations  
- Tokens are earned or purchased — always tied to utility

> “SOUL is not for sale. But it can be shared — and valued.”
